# Salary Prediction Project
This project aims to predict employee salaries based on various features such as age, gender, education level, job title, and years of experience. We trained a linear regression model using historical salary data and saved it for future use. The provided Plumber API allows users to input relevant employee information and receive salary predictions. Whether youâ€™re an HR professional, a job seeker, or a curious data enthusiast, this API can help estimate salaries and inform decision-making.
